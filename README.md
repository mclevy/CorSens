CorSens is a (preliminary) R package to do Monte Carlo Estimation of Sensitivity Indices for Models with Dependent Variables (after Kucherenko et al. 2012)

<<<<<<< HEAD
K12 is a variance decomposition based function for the calculation of sensitivity indices for models with dependent variables that uses Monte Carlo estimation methods and a Gaussian copula based approach for sampling from arbitrary multivariate distributions.

See package documentation (in R) for more details (not yet available through CRAN)
